      Hey there üëã! I study computers and the like at McGill! I am still trying to figure out what I
      enjoy the most, but I hope you can learn more about me regardless.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy making software that people use, not only as tools, but as a <em class="keyword"
        >creative</em
      >
      and <em class="keyword">exploratory</em> outlets ‚Äî anything that helps learning, collaboration,
      or even fun!
    </p>

    <p>
      It's always fun learn, so I keep my mind open to the innumerable facets of the <em
        class="keyword">systems</em
      > that exist today. You never know where you can find something new üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

      For those curious, these are some interesting things I've worked on in the past:

      Currently, I am back in school fighting procrastination and midterms. Previously, I worked
      with data systems and operations at <a class="link" href="https://autodesk.com">Autodesk</a>.
      Before that, I worked on data observability at
      <a class="link" href="https://coveo.com">Coveo </a>
      and at <a class="link" href="https://patternjobs.com">Pattern</a>, developing tools to empower
      the workforce!
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not busy, I usually enjoy listening to
      <a class="link" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/solomon123-ca">music</a>, biking around
      <a class="link" href="https://goo.gl/maps/y21867TsVit1S4Ne8">Montreal</a>, or partaking in
      some casual
      <a class="link" href="/photos"> photography</a>. I even won a
      <a
