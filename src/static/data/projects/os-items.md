These are three interesting projects I completed as a part of my operating systems course.

The first of these projects is a simple [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) capable of
most common tasks. The next project is a user-level thread scheduling library which offers an
API to schedule both CPU and IO tasks on a first come, first serve basis. The final (and my favourite) project is a
simple [FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) filesystem which can be mounted to any Unix directory! Of course, like the other projects, this one also has its limitations.
