A quick project developed at [McHacks 10](https://www.mchacks.ca), _Another Coffee?_ is a simple
application for keeping track of your finances. Using [Veryfi's OCR API](https://www.veryfi.com) to parse
receipt information, the tool allows people to keep track of their finances without a worry!

Building this was an enjoyable endeavour, as I got to work with various technologies first hand, from OCR to
NLP, and more.
