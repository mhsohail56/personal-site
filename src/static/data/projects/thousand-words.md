This is another simple web application I wrote which uses web sockets to allow real-time image sharing with
anyone. The images are displayed as blips on an interactive map, generated through GeoJSON data. After 90 seconds,
the image is erased permanently.

Building this allowed me to become familiar with more development technologies like Docker, AWS, and Node.
