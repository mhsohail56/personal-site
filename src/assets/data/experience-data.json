    "desc": "Spent a really fun summer developing tools to empower the workforce! A lot of my time was spent working on scalable backend services using Express.js (and a whole lot of automated tests). I also worked with observability services (e.g. Datadog) to monitor our web and API processes (also some trace propagation). I got some experience with AWS, developing Lambda applications to synchronize resources with a 3rd-party API. <br /><br />Perhaps my favourite part was working on some data analysis by constructing ETL pipelines and data dashboards using Fivetran, Looker, Snowflake, and dbt. Towards the end of my time here, we started working on a new product, so it was quite interesting to be a part of architecturing infrastructure. Part of this included creating an SSH tunnel via a bastion server ( an AWS EC2 instance) allowing secure and managed connections to our database, which lied in a VPC."
